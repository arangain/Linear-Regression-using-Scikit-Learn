**Linear Regression using Scikit-Learn**

Overview:
- Demonstrates the application of linear regression using the Scikit-Learn library, focusing on handing feature normalization and model training using SGDRegressor.
- The project showcases how to prepare data, create regression models, and make predictions effectively with standardized inputs.

Objectives:
- To illustrate the implementation of linear regression with Scikit-Learn's SGDRegressor.
- To highlight the importance of feature normalization in machine learning workflows.
- To provide insights into the behavior of the SGDRegressor with different data distributions.

Features:
- Use of SGDRegressor from Scikit-Learn to perform linear regression.
- Feature normalization using StandardScaler.
- Comprehensive comparison between predictions and actual values to validate model performance.

Dataset:
- Includes various features of houses, such as size, number of bedrooms, age, and floors, used to predict house prices.
- The script demonstrates how to load and preprocess this data effectively using Scikit-Learn tools.

Visualizations:
- Scatter plots demonstrating the relationship between each feature and house prices.
- Plots comparing predicted versus actual prices using the trained model, illustrating the accuracy and effectiveness of the regression model.
